# i3-gaps-status
My own status made for i3-gaps.

# build-instructions
Open terminal in repository folder
```build-instructions
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make
sudo cp ./i3gs /usr/bin/i3gs
```

For now I dont have any installation progress so this is only way to get it done.

For best effect install Font Awesome from: http://fontawesome.io/


# ToDo

- config file support
- make block presets like CPU/RAM usage or current date
- make presets configurable
